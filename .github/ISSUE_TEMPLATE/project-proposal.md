## Description
<!-- Briefly summarize the proposed project. Strive for one or two sentences of plain language that any user, contributor or stakeholder will understand. -->

## Rationale
<!-- Make the case for the the project. Why is it important? Why should it be done now? What will happen if we don't do it or delay doing it? -->

## Criteria for delivery
<!-- Make a checklist defining the end state of the project. How will we know that the project is complete, i.e. delivered? What will exist at the completion of this project that does not exist now? What will have changed? What communications, promotions and/or documentation will exist to ensure people know about these changes? -->

## Measures of success
<!-- After this project has been delivered, how will we know whether it was a success? What can be measured to indicate that this project was worth the time, effort and compensation it cost? -->

## Risks
<!-- What risks do we run by undertaking the project? What sensitive areas of code are to be modified? What negative implications might this project have on privacy, security, performance, compatibility, maintainability, user experience, etc? -->

## Tasks
<!-- Make a checklist defining in as much detail as is foreseeable who will need to do what in order to deliver the project. The checklist may be modified throughout the course of the project as new tasks emerge. Alternatively, once the project proposal is approved, you may choose to migrate the task checklist to a dedicated GitHub project board. -->
